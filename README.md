Representation Plugins
======================

Here you can find three different packages:

1. `map_handler`, where we provide a VDB-wrapper for semantic data handling.
2. `representation_plugin_base`, where we provide the base class for the Representation Plugins. It also includes the definition of the class implementing the lookup table for the unions of instances as described in the paper.
3. `representation_plugins`, where we provide the implementation of some plugins, handling spatially-grounded semantic information. In this case, you can find two example plugins (`PluginBoxTest`, `PluginAnotherBoxTest`) where we display the usage of the various tools part of this project.
